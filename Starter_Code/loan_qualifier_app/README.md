# Loan Qualifier App

In this project I was pretending to have a role as an application developer at a fintech lending startup. The lending software that my team built so far has been a big success for the company. As part of that success, I've been meeting a lot with the Business Operations team to discuss creating additional useful features.

At a recent meeting, a new, high-priority feature request emerged. Specifically, Buisness operations wants to know if my team's software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

This project was a excellent way to show off my new software engineering skills as I advance in my fintech career.
